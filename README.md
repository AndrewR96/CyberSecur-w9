# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and intercept and attempted attacks in the wild.

## Honeypots Deployed

### Dionaea Sensor
Dionaea is "the Nepenthes successor"a malware capturing honeypot. Dionaea aims to trap malware exploiting vulnerabilities exposed by services offered over a network, and ultimately obtain a copy of the malware.

## Problem Encountered

I encountered issues when I tried to create an firewall for the vm instance, however the google cloud are asking for authorization which I haven't saw from the assignment instruction.  

I encountered issues installing the mhn into my VM at first due to a required site being down (httpbin.org), however that was later, fixed when the github repo with the installation was updated.

I also encoutered issue with get data from external IP. In the homepage of mhm server. The attack stats show 0 however, when I click on the attack report section page. it's shows all country and IP address around the country. I tried restart over again following the same procedure. It give the same result.
